# Password-Hacker
 This password hack application will approach different scenarios for a server's admin.

 All sorts of creatures lurk around the Internet, including trolls, pirates, miners â€“ and hackers. In this project I wear the hat of a real hacker. I connected to a secret server without knowing the password. My task was to write a Python program that can hack this password, and do so in the quickest way possible.
